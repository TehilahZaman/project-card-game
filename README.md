## :spades: Description

Blackjack is a card game with two players; the dealer and you. The goal is to get the value of your cards (AKA hand) to 21 or be the closest to 21. Anything above 21 is an automatic loss. Players can interact with the page, deciding when to have a new card dealt with the 'Hit Me' button and when to end their turn with the 'Stand' button. Players can play for as long as they like and enjoy a relaxing game of BlackJack.
