    <p class="explain">
      The goal of BlackJack is to get the sum of your hand or cards to 21, or
      closer to 21 than your opponant. The player and dealer begin with two
      cards each. The player pushes 'Hit Me' when they want another card delt
      into their hand, if player gets 21 they win, over 21 is a bust. When the
      player is satisfied with their hand, they hit 'Stand' and the dealer's
      turn begins. If the dealer's hand reaches 21 they win, if over 21 it's a
      bust. If no one reaches 21 or over, whoever's sum is closest to 21 wins.
